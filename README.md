# Encoder board with debouncing

This follows the physical dimensions of the common KY-040 type switched encoder
boards, but adds [hardware
debouncing](https://github.com/probonopd/MiniDexed/discussions/178) to allow
simpler software interfacing.

Not yet tested! Use at your own risk (but let me know how it goes).
